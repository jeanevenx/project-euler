# Solving Project Euler Problems

### What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require creative problem-solving skills to solve. 

- It was created by Colin Hughes in 2001 and named after renowned mathematician Leonhard Euler. 

- The problems range from easy to extremely difficult and are meant to offer a challenging brain exercise to those interested in numbers and logic.

My goal is to solve all the challenges of Project Euler to enhance my problem-solving skills and sharpen my logic.
